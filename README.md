# UFO
## Overview of Project
The project was done to build a dynamic webpage with Javascrit bootstrap and html to display and filter UFO sitings for enthusiasts.

## Results
To filter the data a user must type their filter criteria in its respective box as shown below
### Table showing UFO sitings in the city "bonita"

## Summary
The webpage should not display the full table by default as it makes the page unnecessarily long and difficult for some users to scroll through. My recommendation for improving this page would be to allow users to search for a date range of sitings instead of a single day. Also adding the ability to display sighting counts based on shape, city or country and allowing the user to sort either by max/min or Ascending/ Descending order.
